	<h1>ABOUT</h1>
	<div style = "padding-bottom: 10%;">
		<p id = "text">Hi, my name is Taylor.</p>
		<br>
		<p id = "text">I grew up in Woodstown New Jersey, home of the Cowtown Rodeo, is where I spent my childhood before moving up north to the very diverse and integrated Rutgers University community. I developed a love for the sciences and the ocean as a freshman in high school after watching the late Rob Stewarts documentary, "Shark Waters." I've been hooked ever since.</p>
		<br>
		<p id = "text">At Rutgers, I studied Marine Biology in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences. I recently took up a minor in Environmental Policy, Institutions and Behavior (EPIB) looking to expand my horizons and develop an understanding of politics in a way I could appreciate and comprehend. I realized later on my deep passion for being outdoors and the need for an understanding of environmental interactions beyond biology. I decided to switch my major from Marine Biology to Ecology Evolution and Natural resources and haven't looked back since. </p>
		<br>
		<p id = "text">I have worked in many different subjects and have been exposed to a variety of courses giving me invaluable experiences in the field and in the classroom. I have been working in the lab of Paul Falkoswki for three years, and have done research in Woods Hole, MA. In addition, I will be traveling to Antartica in the Spring of 2017 to study phytoplankton as part of a long term ecological research incentive. </p>
		<br>
		<p id = "text">Beyond my studies, some of my many hobbies include hiking, traveling, and anything that gets me outdoors. I am an avid reader and lover of Lord of the Rings and a plethora of other fiction novels. I am also  volunteer fireman at East Franklin Volunteer Fire Department where I have been an active member for 2 years. I also am involved in The Trail, a student run environmental newsletter where I act as a writer and graphic designer.</p>
		<br>
		<p id = "text">After college, I plan on enlisting in the United States Navy before deciding on graduate school. In my future, I hope to be able to bridge the disconnect between science and politics to help create a more efficient system and a better understanding of conservation ecology. I want to increase the understanding and comprehension of conservation within politics to help create a more sustainable future.</p>
